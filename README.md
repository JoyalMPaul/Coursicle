## Project Description

By applying web scraping techniques and parsing HTML documentation from Coursicle, a list of all professors who previously taught a given class was efficiently retrieved. Each entry includes the professor's name, a direct link to their profile, and their rating (if available), enabling quick access to relevant course data. This streamlined approach allows for fast and organized collection of instructor information.

## Bugs / Warnings

You cannot repeatedly use this as coursicle has a captcha set up, which my program isn't designed to bypass. Repeatedly doing this may bypass Coursicle's Terms of Service, so I advice not to do this. Consider the ethics before you continue.
